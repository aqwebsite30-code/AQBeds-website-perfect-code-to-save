          Our story
        </h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          AQ Beds started in 2018 with one idea: sell properly built beds directly, at prices that
          make sense when there is no showroom in the middle. We design the frames, pick the fabrics
          and handle the order ourselves, then ship it free anywhere in the UK. More than 10,000
          customers have slept on one since.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          We design and build premium beds for people who care about how they sleep — and how their
          bedroom looks. Every AQ Bed is engineered for durability, dressed in luxurious fabrics,
          and finished by hand.

          Frames are built from solid timber and high-grade engineered wood, then upholstered in one
          of four fabrics: crushed velvet, plush velvet, chenille and soft matte — sixteen shades in
          total. Mattresses run from a standard comfort foam up to 2000 pocket sprung, with
          orthopaedic options, and every "with mattress" size is cut to the frame you pick.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Storage bases open on a gas-lift mechanism, headboards come in panel, plain, cube and
          chesterfield designs, and divan bases take two or four drawers when you want them.
