    a: "An ottoman bed lifts as one piece — the mattress base rises on gas struts to reveal a single full-size cavity underneath. A divan bed keeps its storage in side drawers built into the base. Ottoman gives you one deep space for bulky items; divan gives you one to four drawers you can open one at a time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which stores more?",
    a: "The ottoman. Because the entire area under the mattress is one cavity, it holds more volume than side drawers, which are limited by the depth of the base. Drawers win on organization and quick access, though.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can an ottoman bed go against a wall?",
    a: "Yes, as long as the foot of the bed has clear space above it for the base to lift. The sides can sit against a wall — that is exactly where a divan's drawers could not open.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do both take the same mattress?",
    a: "Yes. Both are offered in 3ft single to 6ft super king, with the same mattress choices — standard comfort included free, plus memory foam, orthopaedic, 1000 pocket sprung and 2000 pocket sprung.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do they cost?",
    a: "Divan bases start at £185 and ottoman beds start at £350 at the time of writing. Live prices for every size are on each product page — free UK delivery either way.",

        Both hide storage under your mattress, and both come in the same UK sizes with the same
        mattress choices. The difference is how you reach what is inside — and that decides which
        one belongs in your room. Here is the honest comparison, with the real prices on this site
